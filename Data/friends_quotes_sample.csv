22590,28274,5,19,Ross Can`t Flirt,Phoebe,This is so cool!
34683,42300,7,23,Chandler And Monica`s Wedding,Rachel,Ugh! (To Phoebe) What grandmother?
39458,48070,8,21,The Cooking Class,Chandler,I cant even believe this! I really come off that badly?
35623,43517,8,3,Rachel Tells...,Monica,Fine. (Starts to walk away then she runs over and grabs an orange before she exits.) Go! Go! Go!

37741,46088,8,13,Chandler Takes A Bath,Ross,Really? Me too!
26532,32709,6,12,The Joke,Chandler,Seriously?
39317,47904,8,20,The Baby Shower,Monica,"Okay! I will! Mrs. Green? Mrs. Green! (She ignores Monica and Monica follows her out into the hall with Phoebe in tow.) It is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host! Yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it! Now what I did to you, it wasnt on purpose! But what youre during to me now is just plain spiteful!"
43162,52645,9,16,The Boob Job,Chandler,Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection. (kisses monica) Wouldn`t change a thing. Not a thing.

16403,20992,4,13,Rachel`s Crush,Joey,"Well okay, so then youre fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. Its when the heat goes away, thats when youre in trouble."
9558,12480,3,4,The Metaphorical Tunnel,Chandler,"....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store."

26087,32185,6,10,The Routine,Joey,Hey you guys.
23409,29239,5,22,Joey`s Big Break,Joey,"Uh no, not really. It`s an independent film y`know? So we don`t have a real big budget. I figured I`d just stay in your room."
48966,59671,10,16,Rachel`s Going Away Party,Joey,"Come on here, have a seat."
26164,32281,6,10,The Routine,Joey,Uh-huh.

630,781,1,3,The Thumb,Monica,(dubious) I understand.
605,754,1,3,The Thumb,Monica,Nothing. I just think it`s nice when we`re all here together.
49312,60067,10,17,"The Last One, Part I & II",Joey,"Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little."
15218,19587,4,7,Chandler Crosses The Line,Joey,"Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had."
9549,12471,3,4,The Metaphorical Tunnel,Joey,"Yeah, well don`t get me wrong, you`re a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don`t want to blow my pretty dumb brains out."

28029,34444,6,18,Ross Dates A Student,Ross,"What?! No! No! Wait! Youre right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? Theres nothing wrong with that. Come on. (They get up and go over to the table where his colleagues are sitting.) Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth."
16625,21271,4,14,Joey`s Dirty Day,Ross,Are you kidding?!
36566,44656,8,7,The Stain,Ross,"No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available."

(Starts to break down and cry.) Im sorry. And-and some scared memoriesWhoa! (He jumps back, startled.) Eh? And then, and then I realized Ill always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. (Starts to walk away, but realizes something.) Oh! To the happy couple!"
41942,51185,9,9,Rachel`s Phone Number,Chandler,Achhh. It`s always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion. (pause) Except with you.

29192,35902,6,24,"The Proposal, Part I & II",Chandler,(To Monica) You are beautiful.
42486,51831,9,12,Phoebe`s Rats,Monica,Maybe he`s bothering you so much because he likes you. It`s like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?
3202,4275,1,18,All The Poker,Phoebe,"(to Joey): Oh I see, so then, you were lying."
10646,13774,3,9,The Football,Rachel,"God, Im not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too."

27550,33893,6,15,"That Could Have Been, Part I & II",Ross,"Look, its just did, did you ever go to a party and think, `Would really anyone miss me if I werent here?`"
38361,46742,8,15,The Birthing Video,Chandler,"Well, lets just say its ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself."

30862,37786,7,6,The Nap Partners,Joey,"Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how youd handle maid of honor type situations."
13942,18009,3,25,At The Beach,Ross,"Thats not true! Her, she doesnt even know what she wants! Rachels still mad about the whole thing."
